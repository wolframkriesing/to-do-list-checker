# Ideas
- [ ] add command to generate an example`CHANGELOG.md` file
- [ ] add command to the according npm scripts, so releasing is made easy

# version 5.0
- [x] move development to use docker (nix is just not used anywhere by anyone)
- [ ] fix bug in tests2text, it throws `split called on undefined`
  - [ ] the bug was not using `# version X` but `# vX` as headline, which is not really a bug
        show a warning and a hint when not finding the appropriate string
    - [x] prevent a parsing error to throw    
  - [ ] to give the structure of the parsed text a meaning make it typed a bit better
        maybe even use TS for typing and have a `Result` from the parsing process        
- [ ] document usage in README
- [ ] initialize CHANGELOG.md on first run
- [ ] rename the project to something more useful and shorter, easier to spell and remember, not even I can remember the name
- [ ] BUG: the nested items (see above) are not properly understood yet

# version 4.0
